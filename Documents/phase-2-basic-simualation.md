# Basic Simulation Implementation Tasks

## 1. Matter.js Integration
- [x] Install Matter.js and related packages (e.g., react-matter-js if you decide to use it)
- [x] Create a new component for the simulation canvas (e.g., `SimulationCanvas.js`)
- [x] Import necessary Matter.js modules (Engine, Render, World, Bodies, etc.)

## 2. Canvas Setup
- [x] Create a canvas element in the SimulationCanvas component
- [x] Set up the Matter.js engine and renderer
- [x] Define canvas dimensions and styling
- [x] Add rounded corners to the canvas

Notes:
- Created a SimulationCanvas.tsx component with a canvas element
- Defined canvas dimensions (800x600) and background color (#f0f0f0)
- Implemented cleanup function to stop rendering and clear engine when component unmounts
- Added rounded corners and shadow using Tailwind CSS classes

## 3. Basic Physics Objects
- [x] Implement function to create a static ground/floor
- [x] Create functions for generating basic shapes:
  - [x] Rectangles
  - [x] Circles
  - [x] Polygons (triangles, pentagons, etc.)
- [x] Add textures or colors to distinguish different objects

Notes:
- Implemented createGround function to add a static floor to the simulation
- Created various shapes using Matter.js Bodies module:
  - Rectangle: Bodies.rectangle for box and ground
  - Circle: Bodies.circle
  - Polygons: Bodies.polygon for triangle and pentagon
- Added distinct colors to each shape using the render.fillStyle property
- Challenges faced:
  - Ensuring proper positioning of shapes to avoid immediate collisions
  - Balancing shape sizes and positions for an interesting initial layout
  - Implementing cleanup to prevent memory leaks on component unmount

## 4. World Setup
- [x] Create the simulation world
- [x] Add the ground/floor to the world
- [x] Implement gravity and other basic world properties

Notes:
- Created simulation world using Matter.World.create()
- Added ground to the world using World.add(world, ground)
- Set gravity using engine.world.gravity.y = 1
- Updated tests to reflect these changes

## 5. Object Interaction
- [ ] Implement collision detection between objects
- [ ] Add basic properties to objects (mass, restitution, friction)
- [ ] Create a function to add random objects to the world

## 6. Simulation Controls
- [ ] Implement start/stop functionality for the simulation 
- [ ] Add a reset button to clear all objects except the ground
- [ ] Create sliders or input fields for adjusting gravity

## 7. Basic UI for Object Creation
- [ ] Add buttons to create different shapes (circle, rectangle, polygon)
- [ ] Implement click-to-add functionality on the canvas

## 8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement efficient rendering techniques (e.g., using requestAnimationFrame)
- [ ] Add functionality to remove objects that fall off-screen

## 9. State Management
- [ ] Set up state to store current simulation objects
- [ ] Implement functions to update state when objects are added or removed

## 10. Basic Error Handling
- [ ] Add try-catch blocks around Matter.js operations
- [ ] Implement basic error messages for common issues (e.g., canvas not supported)

## 11. Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Add console logs for important simulation events
- [ ] Test simulation with various object combinations
- [ ] Ensure simulation runs smoothly without crashing

## 12. Code Organization
- [ ] Separate Matter.js logic into a custom hook (e.g., useMatterJs)
- [ ] Create utility functions for common operations (e.g., shape creation)

## 13. Documentation
- [ ] Add comments to explain key parts of the simulation setup
- [ ] Create a basic README section explaining how to use the simulation
