These rules enforce:

- Use of TypeScript for all components and modules
- Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components and modules, camelCase for variables and functions)
- React functional components should be done with the latest conventions
- Proper import/export structure
- Don't forget "use client" for dynamic components
- Use of Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes
- When changing tailwind classes, make sure you keep the previews classes to not delete what was done before
- Use of React hooks correctly
- Consistent use of React hooks
- When asked to change something, only change that. Do not add extra functionality or try to refactor unless asked
